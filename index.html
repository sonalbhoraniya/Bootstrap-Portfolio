                                chemistry.
                                I'm a total nerd and love
                                reading, doing puzzles, and learning how to code. I received my undergraduate degree
                                from
                                Duke
                                University in Durham, NC and my doctorate of jurisprudence (law degree) from
                                Vanderbilt
                                University
                                in Nashville, TN.</p>
                            <p class="newfont">When my nose isn't in a book, you can most likely find me wandering
                                outside
                                somewhere - either
                                hiking, running or playing frisbee. Sometimes, I like to just sit by the water and
                                watch
                                the
                                birds
                                fly and the water ripple. I find it very peaceful and calming.</p>

                            <p class="newfont">In the evenings, I'm usually experimenting with a random vegan
                                recipe,
                                seeing
                                how I can trick myself
                                into eating as many vegetables as possible in the most delicious way! And, on the
                                weekends
                                after a
                                long week, I love to reward myself with a freshly popped bowl of popcorn, just
                                doused in
                                vegan
                                butter. YUM!</p>
